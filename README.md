# honeythief
#### Part of B9Lab course. Objective is to steal the ETH from [B9Lab's HoneyPot](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x7164292C87269749bc867AEb9159aCA0F296C1dE)
#### HoneyThief's is deployed on [Ropsten](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xe57ec0794de003ae3c71e36bb9f5ac394407744b)
#### This repository includes HoneyPot.sol, but only so that HoneyThief.sol could be tested locally using truffle.
#### Room for improvement
1. I didn't code a way to get the stolen ETH from HoneyThief to my own account. Not particularly useful for a hacker, but
   as I don't intend to be a professional hacker it's not a big deal.
